  * "The big difference between conda and the pip package manager is in how package dependencies are managed, which is a significant challenge for Python data science and the reason conda exists."
  * "conda analyses the current environment including everything currently installed, and, together with any version limitations specified...works out how to install a compatible set of dependencies, warning if this cannot be done."
